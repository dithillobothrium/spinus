## The Mathematica package for work with dissipative quantum spin dynamics.

Old state-vector dissipation is implemented according the Ref R. Wieser, Eur. Phys. J. B 88, 77 (2015).
The new dissipation is based on Redfield equation, derived for Kondo-induced dissipation. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.progsurf.2016.12.001.
